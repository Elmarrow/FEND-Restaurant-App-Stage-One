#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, there was a conversion of a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Accessibility was added and  the design was converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Moreover a service worker was added to improve the offline experience for the users.

### How to load the page

1. Fork and download the required files from [GitHub](https://github.com/Elmarrow/FEND-Restaurant-App-Stage-One)
In a terminal, go to the folder that you saved the project files and check the version of Python you have using: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).  

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
